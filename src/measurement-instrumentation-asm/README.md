# Manipulating Java Bytecode with ASM

## Class printing with ASM.

The `Printer` class shows how the ASM visitor API can be used to print class information.
The `visit` and `visitEnd` methods are executed for each class visited.
The `visitField` and `visitMethod` methods are executed
for each field and method of that class.

```shell
mvn compile
mvn exec:java@printer
```

## Class generation with ASM

Two examples that both generate the same `Example` class:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        System.out.println ("Hello world !");
    }
}
```

The `GeneratorWithWriter` class uses the `ClassWriter` API directly.
The `GeneratorWithAdapter` class uses the `ClassWriter` API through
the `GeneratorAdapter` class, which provides utility methods for
inserting instructions and keeps track of local variables.

```shell
mvn compile
mvn exec:java@writer
mvn exec:java@adapter
```

Compare the output generated by the standard compiler and ASM:

```shell
javap -c target/classes/Example.class
javap -c target/classes/ExampleWithWriter.class
javap -c target/classes/ExampleWithAdapter.class
```
