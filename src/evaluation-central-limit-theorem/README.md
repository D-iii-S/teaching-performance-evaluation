# Normality Convergence

The notebooks demonstrate how sums of random variables of various distributions
converge to the normal distribution when the samples are either statistically
independent or not.

## Running the example

The example can be rendered in Rstudio. Alternatively,
install the `rmarkdown` package in R and render
from the command line:

```shell
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render ('independent.Rmd')"
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render ('dependent.Rmd')"
```
